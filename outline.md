# Outline

* The RAM Model Computation
    * Each *simple* operation takes one time step
    * Loops and Function Calls are **not** simple operations
    * Each Memory access takes exactly one time step
* Brief recap of Algorithms Class
    * Different Cases
    * It's Greek to me
* Intro to Graphs
    * Graph Definitions
    * Graph Flavors
* Graphs Representation
    * Adjacency List and the Like
        - adjacency set
        - adjacency list --> Represent via Omnigraffle Image (as linked list)
        - adjacency list with edge weights
    * adjancency matrix
        - adjancency matrix with weights
    * Considerations
        - Efficient Graph Representation
* Traversing Mazes
    * Maze Example
    * Arbitrary Walk
        - Connected Components
    * When to stop in case of Circles?
        * Depth-first search
            - recursive
            - iterative
            - Complexity
    * Unique Traversal Algorithm (set or stack)
