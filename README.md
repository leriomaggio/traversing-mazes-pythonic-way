Traversing Mazes the Pythonic Way and other algorithmic adventures
=============================

## EuroPython 2014 talk

All the slides are collected in the `TraversingMazesThePythonWay.ipynb`
iPython notebook.

To generate the HTML version of the slides you need to apply the following
command:

    ipython nbconvert ./TraversingMazesThePythonWay.ipynb --to slides --post serve --config slides_config.py
    
    
Please note that this command is also embedded in the **first** cell of the notebook to allow
for an *inline* HTML slides generation.

## Abstract

**Graphs** define a powerful mental (and mathematical) model of structure, 
representing the building blocks of formulations and/or solutions 
for many *hard problems*. In this talk, graphs and (*some of the*) main 
graph-related algorithms will be analysed from a **very pythonic** angle:
the [Zen of Python][1] (e.g., *beautiful is better than ugly*, 
*simple is better than complex*, *readability counts*).
