Traversing Mazes the Pythonic Way and other algorithmic adventures
=============================

## EuroPython 2014 talk

All the slides are collected in the `TraversingMazesThePythonWay.ipynb`
iPython notebook.

To generate the HTML version of the slides you need to apply the following
command:

    ipython nbconvert ./TraversingMazesThePythonWay.ipynb --to slides --post serve --config slides_config.py
    
    
Please note that this command is also embedded in the **first** cell of the notebook to allow
for an *inline* HTML slides generation.
